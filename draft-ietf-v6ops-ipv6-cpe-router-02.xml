    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies requirements for an IPv6 Customer Edge (CE)
      router. Specifically, the current version of this document focuses on
      the provisioning of an IPv6 CE router and the provisioning of IPv6
      hosts attached to it.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document defines IPv6 features for a residential or small office
      router referred to as an IPv6 CE router. Typically these routers also
      support IPv4. IPv4 support is not discussed any further in this
      document.</t>

      <t>This document specifes how an IPv6 CE router automatically provisions
      its upstream interface, acquires an address block for provisioning of
      its downstream interfaces and fetches other configuration information
      from the service provider network. Automatic provisioning of more
      complex topology than a single router with multiple downstream
      interfaces is out of scope for this document. In IPv6 with the use of
      global addressing, addresses are inherently transient. The implication
      of that for a complex network topology with multiple levels of routers
      is that network wide address renumbering would have to be made
      automatic.</t>

    <section title="Architecture">

      <section title="Current IPv4 end-user network architecture:">

        <t>An end-user network will have to support both IPv4 and IPv6. It is
        not expected that the end-user will have to change the existing
        network topology with the introduction of IPv6. There are some
        differences in how IPv6 works and is provisioned which has
        implications for the network architecture. A typical IPv4 end-user
        network consist of a "plug and play" NAT box connected to the ISP. The
        assumption is a single NAT device with a single link behind it. The
        NAT provides stable addressing allowing for manually configured
        addresses on the nodes in the end-user network.</t>

        <t>Apart from the expert user's arbitrary network topology another
        case is the unconventional use of "plug and play" NAT devices to build
        a hierarchical multi-level NAT topology (as described in
        <xref target="I-D.ford-behave-top">Unintended Consequence of two NAT
        deployments with Overlapping Address Space</xref>). Multi-level NAT
        devices are provisioned and addressed automatically and as long as
        these are plugged in as a strict hierarchy it kind of works even
        though conventional network wisdom would tell you otherwise.</t>

        <t>A typical IPv4 NAT deployment gives you by default blocking of all
        incoming connections. Opening of ports is typically allowed using UPnP
        or some other firewall control protocol.</t>

        <t>Another consequence of using private address space in the end-user
        network is that it provides stable addressing, i.e. it never changes
        even when you change ISPs, and the addresses are always there even
        when the upstream link is down or the customer edge router has not
        been provisioned yet.</t>

        <t>Rewriting addresses on the edge of the network also allows for some
        rudimentary multi-homing; even though using NATs for multi-homing does
        not preserve connections during fail-overs.</t>

        <t>Existing routers support dynamic routing, and advanced end-user can
        build arbitrary complex networks. Using manual configuration of
        address prefixes combined with a dynamic routing protocol.</t>

        <t>The end-user network architecture for IPv6 should provide
        equivalent or better capabilities and functionality than the

      <t>For the purposes of provisioning the address on its WAN interface the
      IPv6 CE router acts as a host using either SLAAC or DHCP. Other
      configuration information is acquired using DHCP as described
      in <xref target="RFC3315"></xref>. The IPv6 CE router acts as a
      requesting router for the purposes of prefix delegation and always
      initiates prefix delegation according
      to <xref target="RFC3633"></xref>.</t>

@@OT describe architecture not requirements.

      <t>The IPv6 CE router assigns a /64 from its delegated prefix(es) to
      each of its downstream LAN interfaces.  It may also generate a Unique
      Local Address prefix [citation] and assign a ULA /64 prefix to each of
      its LAN interfaces for communciation within the home network.</t>

      <t>IPv6 hosts acquire IPv6 addresses either through SLAAC or DHCP. The
      IPv6 CE router provides configuration information obtained from
      provisioning of the WAN interface to the hosts on the downstream
      interface(s) using DHCP.</t>

      <t>The IPv6 CE router default to acting as the demarcation point between
      two networks and implements a ULA boundary, a multicast zone boundary as
      well as ingress and egress traffic filters.</t>

      <t>For IPv6 multicast traffic the IPv6 CE router acts as an MLD proxy
      and may support a dynamic multicast routing protocol.</t>

      <t>IPv6 CE router may be manually configured in an arbitrary topology
      with a dynamic routing protocol. Automatic provisioning and
      configuration is described for a single IPv6 CE router only.</t>

    <section title="Use Cases and Requirements">
      <section title="IPv6 CE router WAN configuration">
        <t>The IPv6 CE router will need to support connectivity to one or more
        access network architectures. This document describes a IPv6 CE router
        that is not specific to any particular architecture or service
        provider, and supports all commonly used architectures.</t>

        <t>IPv6 Neighbor Discovery and DHCP protocols operate over any type
        of IPv6 supported link-layer and there is no need for a link-layer
        specific configuration protocol for IPv6 network layer configuration
        options like what's e.g. in PPP IPCP for IPv4. This section makes the
        assumption that the same mechanism will work for any link-layer, be it
        Ethernet, DOCSIS, PPP/PPPoE or others.</t>

        <t>When the router is attached to the upstream link it must act as an
        IPv6 host for the purposes of IPv6 interface initialisation, neighbor
        discovery router discovery, prefix discovery and interface address
        assignment (<xref target="RFC4861">RFC
        4861</xref>/<xref target="RFC4862">RFC 4862</xref>). The router acts
        as a requesting router for the purposes of DHCP prefix delegation
        (<xref target="RFC3633">RFC 3633</xref>).</t>

        <t>The IPV6 CE router will always initiate DHCP prefix delegation,
        regardless of the M and O-bits in a received Router Advertisement. On
        router-router links were RAs MAY not be used the IPv6 CE router
        should initiate DHCP PD even when an RA has not been received. Both
        address assignment and prefix delegation should be done within a
        single DHCP session.</t>

        <t>Link-layer requirements:<list style='format W-%d:'>
            <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST support IPv6 over Ethernet (RFC
            2464).</t>
            <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST support IPv6 over PPP (RFC 5072). It
            MUST support use of IPv6 over PPP within PPPoE.</t>
        </list></t>

        <t>Address assignment requirements:<list style='format W-%d:'>
            <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST support SLAAC

            <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST support
            DHCP <xref target="RFC3315"></xref> client behavior. It
            MUST be able to support the following DHCP options: IA_NA,
            Reconfigure Accept(<xref target="RFC3315"></xref>),
            DNS_SERVERS (<xref target="RFC3646"></xref>).</t>

            <t>Th IPv6 CE router SHOULD support the DHCP SNTP option
            (<xref target="RFC4075"></xref>).</t>

            <t>If the IPv6 CE router receives an RA message (described
            in <xref target="RFC4861"></xref>) with the M-bit set to 1, the
            IPv6 CE router MUST request an IA_NA. If the IPv6 CE router is

            <t>If the IPv6 CE router does not acquire a global IPv6 address
            from either SLAAC or DHCP, then it MUST create a global IPv6
            address from its delegated prefix and configure that on one of its
            internal interfaces.</t>

            <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST support DHCP prefix delegation
            requesting router behaviour as specified
            in <xref target="RFC3633">RFC3633</xref> (IA_PD option). The IPv6
            CE router MUST ask for a prefix large enough to cover all of its
            LAN interfaces.</t>

            <t>A null route SHOULD be added to the routing table for the
            delegated prefix (to prevent routing loops) that is lower priority
            than any route except the default route.  The choice to drop the
            packet or send an ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable to the source

            (IA_NA options with status code NoAddrsAvail).</t>

            and it MUST install default route(s) in its RIB for the list of
            default routers. If no Router Advertisement with a Router Lifetime
            greater than zero is received, the default route MUST be installed
            using the link-local source address of the PD delegating router as
            the next-hop.</t>

      <section title="IPv6 CE router LAN configuration">

        <t>The IPv6 CE router distributes configuration information obtained
        during WAN interface provisioning to IPv6 hosts and assists IPv6 hosts
        in obtaining IPv6 addresses. It also supports connectivity of these
        devices in the absence of any working WAN interface.</t>

        <t>An IPv6 CE router will be expected to support an IPv6 end-user
        network and IPv6 hosts that exhibit the following characteristics:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>Link-local addresses are insufficient for allowing IPv6
            applications to communicate with each other in the end-user
            network. The IPv6 CE router will need to enable this
            communication by providing globally-scoped unicast addresses
            or ULAs whether or not WAN connectivity exists.</t>

            <t>IPv6 hosts will be capable of using SLAAC and may be capable of
            using DHCP for acquiring their addresses.</t>

            <t>IPv6 hosts will use DHCP for other configuration information,
            such as the DNS_SERVERS option for acquiring DNS
            information.</t>

        </List></t>

        <t>Requirements:<list style='format L-%d:'>
          <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST support ULA addressing
          (<xref target="RFC4193">RFC4193</xref>).</t>
          <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST have a ULA prefix that it maintains
          consistently across reboots. The value of the ULA prefix SHOULD be
          user configurable.</t>

          <t>The IPv6 CE router by default MUST act as a site border router
          according to section 4.3 of RFC4193 and filter packets with Local
          IPv6 source or destination addresses accordingly.</t>

          <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST support router behavior of Neighbor
          Discovery for IPv6 (<xref target="RFC4861">RFC4861</xref>).</t>
          <t>If the IPv6 CE router is configured to provide ULA addressing to
          IPv6 hosts, it MUST provide a /64 prefix from its ULA prefix in its
          RA message. This prefix MUST have A/L-bits set to 1 by default; this
          SHOULD be user configurable.</t>
          <t>The IPv6 CE router must assign a separate /64 from its delegated
          prefix for each of its LAN-interfaces. In router advertisements
          messages this prefix MUST have A/L-bits set to 1 by default; this
          SHOULD be user configurable.</t>

          <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST support a DHCP server
          (<xref target="RFC3315">RFC 3315</xref>) on its
          LAN interfaces. It SHOULD support DHCP address assignment
          (IA_NA).</t>
          <t>Unless the IPv6 CE router is configured to support DHCP IA_NA,
          it SHOULD set M=0 and O=1 in its RA messages.</t>
          <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST support providing DNS information in the
          DHCP DNS_SERVERS option
          (<xref target="RFC3646">RFC3646</xref>).</t>
          <t>The IPv6 CE router SHOULD pass the additional set of DHCP
          options received from the DHCP client on its WAN interface from the
          Service Provider to IPv6 hosts.</t>

      <section title="IPv6 CE router">

        <t>The IPv6 CE router is responsible for implementing IPv6 routing;
        that is, the IPv6 CE router must look up the IPv6 Destination address
        in its routing table to decide to which interface it should send the
        packet. The typical scenario for packets routed to the WAN Interface
        is that the next-hop router will be the CPE Router's default route,
        learned via Router Advertisement from the Service Provider router.</t>

        <t>In this role, the IPv6 CE router is responsible for ensuring that
        traffic using its ULA addressing does not go out the WAN interface,
        and does not originate from the WAN interface.</t>

        <t>Requirements:<list style='format F-%d:'>
            <t>An IPv6 CE router is an IPv6 node and MUST follow
            the <xref target="RFC4294">IPv6 Node Requirements</xref>
            specification.</t>
            <t>The IPv6 CE router may discover other devices on the network
            connected to the WAN interface using ND.  Consistent with
            [RFC4943], unless the L bit in the RA is set to 1, the CPE Router
            SHOULD assume that such devices are "not-on-link", so traffic for
            such devices SHOULD be forwarded to the default router.</t>
            <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST NOT forward any IPv6 traffic between
            its LAN Interface(s) and its WAN Interface until the router has
            successfully completed the IPv6 address acquisition process.</t>
        </list></t>

      </section>

      <section title="Security Considerations">
        <t>It is considered a best practice to filter obviously malicious
        traffic (e.g. spoofed packets, "martian" addresses, etc.).  Thus, the
        IPv6 CE router should support basic stateless egress and ingress
        filters.  The CE router should also offer mechanisms to filter
        traffic entering the customer network; however, the method by which
        vendors implement configurable packet filtering is beyond the scope of
        this document.</t>
