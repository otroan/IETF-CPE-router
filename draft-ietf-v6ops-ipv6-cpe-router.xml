      <t>This document specifies requirements for an IPv6 Customer

      and the provisioning of IPv6 hosts attached to it.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document defines basic IPv6 features for a residential
      or small office router referred to as an IPv6 CE
      router. Typically these routers also support IPv4.</t>

      <t>Mixed environments of dual-stack hosts and IPv6-only hosts
      (behind the CE router) can be more complex if the IPv6-only
      devices are using a translator to access IPv4 servers <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-framework"></xref>.  Support for
      such mixed environments is not in scope of this document.</t>

      <t>This document specifies how an IPv6 CE router automatically
      provisions its WAN interface, acquires address space for
      provisioning of its LAN interfaces and fetches other
      configuration information from the service provider
      network. Automatic provisioning of more complex topology than a
      single router with multiple LAN interfaces is out of scope for
      this document.</t>

    <section title="Architecture">

      <section title="Current IPv4 End-user Network Architecture">

        <t>An end-user network will likely support both IPv4 and
        IPv6. It is not expected that an end-user will change their
        existing network topology with the introduction of IPv6. There
        are some differences in how IPv6 works and is provisioned
        which has implications for the network architecture. A typical
        IPv4 end-user network consist of a "plug and play" router with
        NAT functionality and a single link behind it, connected to
        the Service Provider network.</t>

        <t>A typical IPv4 NAT deployment by default blocks all
        incoming connections. Opening of ports is typically allowed
        using UPnP IGD <xref target="UPnP-IGD"></xref> or some other
        firewall control protocol.</t>

        <t>Another consequence of using private address space in the
        end-user network is that it provides stable addressing,
        i.e. it never changes even when you change Service Providers,
        and the addresses are always there even when the WAN interface
        is down or the customer edge router has not yet been
        provisioned.</t>

        <t>Rewriting addresses on the edge of the network also allows for some
        rudimentary multi-homing; even though using NATs for multi-homing does
        not preserve connections during
        a fail-over event <xref target="RFC4864"></xref>.</t>

        <t>Many existing routers support dynamic routing, and advanced end
        users can build arbitrary, complex networks using manual configuration
        of address prefixes combined with a dynamic routing protocol.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="IPv6 End-user Network Architecture">

        <t>The end-user network architecture for IPv6 should provide
        equivalent or better capabilities and functionality than the
        current IPv4 architecture.</t>

        <t>The end-user network is a stub network. Figure 1 illustrates the
        model topology for the end-user network.</t>

        <t>The IPv6 CE router is responsible for implementing IPv6 routing;
        that is, the IPv6 CE router must look up the IPv6 Destination address
        in its routing table to decide to which interface it should send the
        packet.</t>

        <t>In this role, the IPv6 CE router is responsible for ensuring that
        traffic using its ULA addressing does not go out the WAN interface,
        and does not originate from the WAN interface.</t>

	  <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST implement ICMP according to <xref
	  target="RFC4443"></xref>. In particular point to point links
	  MUST be handled as described in section 3.1 of <xref
	  target="RFC4443"></xref>.</t>

	  <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST NOT forward any IPv6 traffic

      <section title="WAN Side Configuration">
        <t>The IPv6 CE router will need to support connectivity to one
        or more access network architectures. This document describes
        an IPv6 CE router that is not specific to any particular
        architecture or Service Provider, and supports all commonly
        used architectures.</t>

        <t>IPv6 Neighbor Discovery and DHCPv6 protocols operate over
        any type of IPv6 supported link-layer and there is no need for
        a link-layer specific configuration protocol for IPv6 network
        layer configuration options as in e.g. PPP IPCP for IPv4. This
        section makes the assumption that the same mechanism will work
        for any link-layer, be it Ethernet, DOCSIS, PPP or others.</t>

        <t>WAN side requirements:
	<list style='format W-%d:'>
	  <t>When the router is attached to the WAN interface link it
	  MUST act as an IPv6 host for the purposes of stateless or
	  stateful interface address assignment (<xref
	  target="RFC4862"></xref>/<xref
	  target="RFC3315"></xref>).</t>

	  <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST generate a link-local address and
	  finish Duplicate Address Detection according to <xref
	  target="RFC4862"></xref> prior to sending any Router
	  Solicitations on the interface. The source address used in
	  the subsequent Router Solicitation MUST be the link-local
	  address on the WAN interface.</t>

	  <t>Absent of other routing information the IPv6 CE router
	  MUST use Router Discovery as specified in <xref
	  target="RFC4861"></xref> to discover a default router(s) and
	  install default route(s) in its routing table with the
	  discovered router's address as the next-hop.</t>

	  <t>The router MUST act as a requesting router for the
	  purposes of DHCPv6 prefix delegation (<xref
	  target="RFC3633"></xref>).</t>

	  <t>DHCPv6 address assignment (IA_NA) and DHCPv6 prefix
	  delegation (IA_PD) SHOULD be done as a single DHCPv6

            in particular the handling of the L-flag in the Router
            Advertisement Prefix Information Option.</t>

	    <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST support DHCPv6 <xref
	    target="RFC3315"></xref> client behavior.</t>

	    <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST be able to support the

	    target="RFC3646"></xref>.</t>

	    <t>The IPv6 CE router SHOULD support the DHCPv6 SNTP
	    option <xref target="RFC4075"></xref> and the Information
	    Refresh Time Option <xref target="RFC4242"></xref>.</t>

	    <t>If the IPv6 CE router receives an RA message (described
	    in <xref target="RFC4861"></xref>) with the M-flag set to
	    1, the IPv6 CE router MUST do DHCPv6 address assignment
	    (request an IA_NA option).</t>

	    <t>If the IPv6 CE router is unable to assign address(es)
	    through SLAAC it MAY do DHCPv6 address assignment (request
	    an IA_NA) even if the M-flag is set to 0.</t>

            <t>If the IPv6 CE router does not acquire global IPv6
            address(es) from either SLAAC or DHCPv6, then it MUST
            create global IPv6 address(es) from its delegated
            prefix(es) and configure those on one of its internal
            virtual network interfaces.</t>

	    <t>As a router the IPv6 CE router MUST follow the weak
	    host model <xref target="RFC1122"></xref>. When

	  <t>The IPv6 CE router MAY indicate as a hint to the
	  delegating router the size of the prefix it requires. If so,
	  it MUST ask for a prefix large enough to assign one /64 for
	  each of its interfaces rounded up to the nearest nibble and
	  MUST be configurable to ask for more.</t>

	  <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST be prepared to accept a delegated
	  prefix size different from what is given in the hint. If the
	  delegated prefix is too small to address all of its
	  interfaces, the IPv6 CE router SHOULD log a system
	  management error.</t>

	  <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST always initiate DHCPv6 prefix
	  delegation, regardless of the M and O-flags in a received
	  Router Advertisement message.</t>

	  <t>If the IPv6 CE Router initiates DHCPv6 before receiving a
	  Router Advertisement it MUST also request an IA_NA option in
	  DHCPv6.</t>

	  <t>If the delegated prefix(es) are aggregate route(s) of
	  multiple, more-specific routes, the IPv6 CE router MUST
	  discard packets that match the aggregate route(s), but not
	  any of the more-specific routes. In other words, the
	  next-hop for the aggregate route(s) should be the null
	  destination. This is necessary to prevent forwarding loops
	  when some addresses covered by the aggregate are not
	  reachable <xref target="RFC4632"></xref>.

	  <t>If the IPv6 CE router requests both an IA_NA and an IA_PD
	  in DHCPv6, it MUST accept an IA_PD in DHCPv6 Advertise/Reply
	  messages, even if the message does not contain any addresses
	  (IA_NA options with status code equal to NoAddrsAvail).</t>

      <section title="LAN Side Configuration">

        <t>The IPv6 CE router distributes configuration information obtained
        during WAN interface provisioning to IPv6 hosts and assists IPv6 hosts
        in obtaining IPv6 addresses. It also supports connectivity of these
        devices in the absence of any working WAN interface.</t>

        <t>An IPv6 CE router is expected to support an IPv6 end-user
        network and IPv6 hosts that exhibit the following
        characteristics:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>Link-local addresses are insufficient for allowing IPv6
            applications to communicate with each other in the
            end-user network. The IPv6 CE router will need to enable
            this communication by providing globally-scoped unicast
            addresses or ULAs <xref target="RFC4193"></xref> whether
            or not WAN connectivity exists.</t>

            <t>IPv6 hosts should be capable of using SLAAC and may be
            capable of using DHCPv6 for acquiring their addresses.</t>

            <t>IPv6 hosts may use DHCPv6 for other configuration
            information, such as the DNS_SERVERS option for acquiring
            DNS information.</t>

        </list></t>

        <t>Unless otherwise specified, the following requirements
        apply to the IPv6 CE router's LAN interfaces only.</t>

        <t>Requirements:<list style='format L-%d:'>
          <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST support ULA addressing <xref
          target="RFC4193"></xref>.</t>

          <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST have a ULA prefix that it
          maintains consistently across reboots.</t>

	  <t>The value of the ULA prefix SHOULD be user
	  configurable.</t>

          <t>By default the IPv6 CE router MUST act as a site border
          router according to section 4.3 of <xref
          target="RFC4193"></xref> and filter packets with Local IPv6
          source or destination addresses accordingly.</t>

          <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST support router behavior according
          to Neighbor Discovery for IPv6 <xref
          target="RFC4861"></xref>.</t>

	  <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST assign a separate /64 from its
	  delegated prefix(es) (and ULA prefix if configured to
	  provide ULA addressing) for each of its LAN interfaces.</t>

	  <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST make each LAN interface an
	  advertising interface according to [RFC4861].</t>

	  <t>In Router Advertisements messages, the Prefix Information
	  Option's A and L-flags MUST be set to 1 by default.</t>

	  <t>The A and L-flags setting SHOULD be user configurable.</t>

	  <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST support a DHCPv6 server capable
	  of IPv6 address assignment according to <xref
	  target="RFC3315"></xref> OR a stateless DHCPv6 server
	  according to <xref target="RFC3736"></xref> on its LAN
	  interfaces.</t>

	  <t>Unless the IPv6 CE router is configured to support the
	  DHCPv6 IA_NA option, it SHOULD set M=0 and O=1 in its Router
	  Advertisement messages <xref target="RFC4861"></xref>.</t>
	  
          <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST support providing DNS information
          in the DHCPv6 DNS_SERVERS option <xref
          target="RFC3646"></xref>.</t>

          <t>The IPv6 CE router SHOULD make available a subset of
          DHCPv6 options (as listed in section 5.3 of <xref
          target="RFC3736"></xref>) received from the DHCPv6 client on
          its WAN interface to its LAN side DHCPv6 server.</t>

	  <t>If the delegated prefix changes, i.e. the current prefix
	  is replaced with a new prefix without any overlapping time
	  period, then the IPv6 CE router MUST immediately advertise
	  the old prefix with a preferred lifetime of 0 and a valid
	  lifetime of 2 hours (which must be decremented in real
	  time) in a Router Advertisement message.</t>

	  <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST send an ICMP Destination
	  Unreachable Message, code 5 (Source address failed
	  ingress/egress policy) for packets forwarded to it using an
	  address from a prefix which has been deprecated.</t>

      <section title="Security Considerations">
        <t>It is considered a best practice to filter obviously malicious
        traffic (e.g. spoofed packets, "martian" addresses, etc.).  Thus, the
        IPv6 CE router should support basic stateless egress and ingress
        filters.  The CE router should also offer mechanisms to filter
        traffic entering the customer network; however, the method by which
        vendors implement configurable packet filtering is beyond the scope of
        this document.</t>
